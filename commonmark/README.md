This package is a test suite for Blackfriday's CommonMark compatibility.  The
package is protected by a "commonmark" build tag so that it won't interfere with
the existing blackfriday package.  When full compatibility is reached, it should
be moved to the main test suite.

Run the tests with `go test -tags commonmark ./...`.  The tests are broken down
into sections, so you can use normal Go tool semantics for test selection:

```
go test -tags commonmark -run=TestCommonMark/Tabs
go test -tags commonmark -run=/Tabs
```

The `testdata/commonmark-tests-dump.json` was generated by running the following
commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:commonmark/CommonMark.git
$ cd CommonMark
$ python3 test/spec_tests.py --dump-tests > commonmark-tests-dump.json
```
